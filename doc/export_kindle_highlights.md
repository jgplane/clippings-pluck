# How To Export Kindle Highlights

The `ClippingsPluck` module can process strings read from two different files
that you can export from the Kindle ecosystem. Here is how to get ahold of
either file:

## Plaintext "My Clippings.txt"

This file contains notes and highlights from across all of your books.

Plug your Kindle into a computer using a USB cord. Inside your Kindle you'll
see a "Documents" folder. Open it and scroll down until you see the "My Clippings.txt"
file. Copy this file to your computer.

## CSV Export

You can also export notes and highlights from a single book. With the book open,
all you need to do is go to your notes. There you will see an "Export" button.
Amazon will send you an email with the CSV file attached.
